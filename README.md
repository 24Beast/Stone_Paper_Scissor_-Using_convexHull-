# Stone_Paper_Scissor_-Using_convexHull-
Hi, 
The program uses Python libraries like opencv, numpy and matplotlib to function.
The convexHull function has been used to estimate the symbols(Stone, Paper or Scissor) shown by the user.

While playing, ensure that objects in the play area are in rest with respect to your device. The motion of other objects can 
lead to inaccurate prediction of symbol displayed. Thus, a relatively plain background(like a wall) is preferred. 

Poor lighting may lead to poor symbol prediction. Keep your palm parallel to the camera for accurate predictions.

To play, simply display your choice when it says Scissors and try to beat the system if you can!

Have Fun!
